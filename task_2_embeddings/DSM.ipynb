    "## Representations of single Words\n",
    "There are different ways to represent single words at the input of a machine learning algorithm. The conventional (old) way is to apply a **one-hot-encoding**. In this approach each word is represented by a vector $\\mathbf{v_w}$, whose length is given by the number of words in the applied vocabulary $V$. Each word $w \\in V$ is uniquely mapped to an integer $i_w \\in [0,|V|]$ and the one-hot encoded word-vector $\\mathbf{v_w}$ contains a 1 at position $i_w$ and zeros at all other positions. Drawbacks of the one-hot representation of words are:\n",
    "* the one-hot encoded vectors are very long and sparse\n",
    "* semantic or syntactic relations between words, can not be infered from the corresponding one-hot encoded vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The better way of representing words is to apply a **word-embedding**. Word embeddings have revolutionalized many fields of Natural Language Processing since their efficient neural-network-based generation has been published in [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) by Mikolov et al (2013). Word embeddings map words into vector-spaces such that semantically or syntactically related words are close together, whereas unrelated words are far from each other. Moreover, it has been shown that the word-embeddings, generated by *word2vec*-techniques *CBOW* or *Skipgram*, are well-structured in the sense that also relations such as *is-capital-of*, *is-female-of*, *is-plural-of* are encoded in the vector space. In this way questions like *woman is to queen, as man is to ?* can be answered by simple operations of linear algebra in the word-vector-space. Compared to the length of one-hot encoded word-vectors, word-embedding-vectors are short (typical lengths in the range from 100-300) and dense (float-values). \n",
    "\n",
    "![DSM concept](./Pics/dsm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*CBOW* and *Skipgram*, are techniques to learn word-embeddings, i.e. a mapping of words to vectors by relatively simple neural networks. Usually large corpora are applied for learning, e.g. the entire Wikipedia corpus in a given language. Today, pretrained models for the most common languages are available, for example from this [Facebook github repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md?utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=buffer0df9b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com).\n",

The embedding has been trained with CBOW from the dump of the entire german Wikipedia in notebook [K03generateCBOWfromWiki.ipynb](K03generateCBOWfromWiki.ipynb)\n"

    "## Representations of Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-Word model\n",
    "The conventional way of modelling documents in tasks like information-retrieval, document-clustering, document-classification, sentiment-analysis, topic-classification is to represent each document as a **Bag-Of-Word**-vector $$\\mathbf{d}_i=(tf_{i,0},tf_{i,1},\\ldots tf_{i,|V|}).$$ Each component of this vector corresponds to a single term $j$ of the underlying vocabulary $V$ and the values $tf_{i,j}$ counts the frequency of term $j$ in document $i$. Instead of the term-frequency $tf_{i,j}$ it is also possible to fill the BoW-vector with \n",
    "* a binary indicator which indicates if the term $j$ appears in document $i$\n",
    "* the tf-idf-values $$tfidf_{i,j}=tf_{i,j} \\cdot log \\frac{N}{df_j},$$ where $df_j$ is the frequency of documents, in which term $j$ appears, and $N$ is the total number of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent of the values used, the BoW-model has the following major drawbacks:\n",
    "* the order by which terms appear in the document is totally ignored\n",
    "* semantic relatedness of terms is not modelled\n",
    "* BoW- vectors are very long and sparse\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequences of Word-Vectors\n",
    "Using word-embeddings all of the mentioned drawbacks of BoW-modells can be avoided. One approach is to represent the sequence of words in the document as a sequence of word-embedding vectors. These sequences can then be passed to e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Long-Short-Term-Memory Networks (LSTM).  \n",

    "![BoWvsEmbedding](./Pics/bowVsEmbedding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector-Representations of Sentences, Paragraphs and Documents\n",
    "Word-Embeddings are based on the idea, that semantically related words can be mapped to vectors, which are close together. Where two words are semantically related, if they frequently appear in the same context (neighbouring words). This idea can also be applied to sentences or word-sequences in general. By applying e.g. LSTMs, Doc2Vec, Encoder-Decoder architectures etc. vector representations of texts can be generated, such that semantically related texts have similiar vector-representations. \n"

    "## CBOW- and Skipgram- Wordembedding\n",
    "In 2013 Mikolov et al. published [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf). They proposed quite simple neural network architectures to efficiently create word-embeddings: CBOW and Skipgram. These architectures are better known as **Word2Vec**. In both techniques neural networks are trained for a pseudo-task. After training, the network itself is usually not of interest. However, the learned weights in the input-layer constitute the word-embeddings, which can then be applied for a large field of NLP-tasks, e.g. document classification."

This vector representation is the input of a softmax-output-layer. The output-layer has as much neurons as there are words in the vocabulary $V$.
